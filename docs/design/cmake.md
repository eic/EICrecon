## plugins CMake API

There is a copy/paste CMake file that should automatically create plugin out of sources. 

- plugin name is taken from a directory name
- there should be /</plugin name/>/.cc file with `void InitPlugin(JApplication *app)` function


### Create a plugin:

E.g. if you want to create a plugin named `my_plugin`

- Create a directory `my_plugin`
- Create a file `my_plugin.cc` which will have `InitPlugin` function
- Create `CMakeLists.txt` with the content below 
- Add all others files (cmake GLOB is used)

### Recommended cmake:

Recommended CMake for a plugin:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
cmake_policy(SET CMP0074 NEW)  # use the policy to look for <package>_ROOT envar

# Automatically set plugin name the same as the direcotry name
# Don't forget string(REPLACE " " "_" PLUGIN_NAME ${PLUGIN_NAME}) if this dir has spaces in its name
get_filename_component(PLUGIN_NAME ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR} NAME)
print_header(">>>>   P L U G I N :   ${PLUGIN_NAME}    <<<<")       # Fancy printing

# Function creates ${PLUGIN_NAME}_plugin and ${PLUGIN_NAME}_library targets
# Setting default includes, libraries and installation paths
plugin_add(${PLUGIN_NAME})

# Find dependencies
find_package(JANA REQUIRED)
find_package(EDM4HEP REQUIRED)
find_package(podio REQUIRED)
find_package(DD4hep REQUIRED)
find_package(ROOT REQUIRED)

# The macro grabs sources as *.cc *.cpp *.c and headers as *.h *.hh *.hpp
# Then correctly sets sources for ${_name}_plugin and ${_name}_library targets
# Adds headers to the correct installation directory
plugin_glob_all(${PLUGIN_NAME})

# Add include directories
# (same as target_include_directories but for both plugin and library)
plugin_include_directories(${PLUGIN_NAME} SYSTEM PUBLIC ${JANA_INCLUDE_DIR} ${podio_INCLUDE_DIR} ${EDM4HEP_INCLUDE_DIR} ${DD4hep_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${ROOT_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Add libraries
# (same as target_include_directories but for both plugin and library)
plugin_link_libraries(${PLUGIN_NAME} ${JANA_LIB})
```

### CMake macros:

There are `plugin_...` macros that are slim wrappers trying to minimize an amount of boilerplate
code of each plugin cmake scripts. Macros mimic CMake functions like `target_link_libraries` => `plugin_link_libraries`.
 

#### plugin_add

```cmake
# Function creates ${PLUGIN_NAME}_plugin target
# Sets default includes, libraries and installation paths
plugin_add(my_plugin)
```

It is possible to also automatically crate a static library from a plugin 
sources in addition to the plugin itself. Adding `WITH_STATIC_LIBRARY` to 
`plugin_add`. All other `plugin_xxx` functions will know about the second target then.

```cmake
# Now function will create 2 targets and ${PLUGIN_NAME}_plugin ${PLUGIN_NAME}_library
# one can add WITH_STATIC_LIBRARY flag to also create a static library with plugin sources
plugin_add(my_plugin WITH_STATIC_LIBRARY)
```

If `WITH_STATIC_LIBRARY` flag is given, all `plugin_...` macros will work on both targets: 
a plugin and a static library.

#### plugin_glob_all

The macro grabs sources as *.cc *.cpp *.c and headers as *.h *.hh *.hpp
Then correctly sets sources for ${plugin_name}_plugin and ${plugin_name}_library
targets (if library is enabled). 
Adds headers to the correct installation directory

```cmake
plugin_glob_all(my_plugin)
```

#### plugin_sources

Same as target_sources both for library (if enabled) and a plugin.
If library creation is enabled, the function automatically removes 
`/</plugin-name/>/.cc` file from library sources

```cmake
plugin_sources(my_plugin File1.cc File2.cc)
```

### plugin_include_directories

Runs target_include_directories for both a plugin and a library (if enabled)

```cmake
#example 
plugin_include_directories(${PLUGIN_NAME} SYSTEM PUBLIC  ${ROOT_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

### plugin_link_libraries
Runs target_link_libraries for both a plugin and a library (if enabled)

```cmake
# example
plugin_link_libraries(${PLUGIN_NAME} ${JANA_LIB})
```
