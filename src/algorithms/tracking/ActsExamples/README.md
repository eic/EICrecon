The files in this directory are based on examples files distributed as part of
the Acts repository under directories `Examples/$1/$2/include/Acts/$1/$2`.
In order to simplify future maintenance, they are provided here with the same
name and in the same directory structure as in the Acts repository. Please do
consider carefully the future maintenance burden accepted when changing this
set of include files.
