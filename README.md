# EICrecon
JANA based reconstruction for the EPIC detector

The repository contains reconstruction source code for the EPIC detector. It's function
is to take real or simulated data and reconstruct it into physical values
for later analysis.

If you are new to EIC software then you should start with the tutorials which
can be found here:

A preliminary tutorial on JANA2 is being developed here:
